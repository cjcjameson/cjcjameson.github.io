<p>
Hi there! I'm C.J. Jameson. I'm an Engineering Manager at Monte Carlo Data.
<br>
What's my work style? My resume lists ENTP, Adaptability, Connectedness, etc. But here’s what they mean.
<br>
I think on my feet, pattern-match, and generate abstractions. I talk through
discoveries and use metaphors to grapple with new code blocks. I’m an intuitive
learner, so “aha moments” push me to the next level of understanding an
engineering problem.
<br>
I adapt and think ahead because all too often, "the business needs have
changed" is the norm. I anticipate my code's connections with other
modules, and think ahead about how to test my code.
<br>
I listen carefully to my colleagues and contribute heavily to team discussion.
I'm "plugged in" to the teams around me and I rejoice in helping other
devs past a barrier that I have surmounted. Above all, I am empathetic to each
person around me. "Go-giver"
</p>
