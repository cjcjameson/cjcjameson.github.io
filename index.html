    <p> Hi there! I'm C.J. Jameson. I've been coding since 2008, but I'm excited to finally be putting this all into practice!</p>
    <p> At Stanford, I took 5 CS courses (Java and C++, algorithms and statistical analysis, etc.), but never got immersed in the coding culture.<br />
    I still feel like it's always been part of my DNA. I currently work as a management consultant for biotechs, but I'm most excited when I get to put my engineer's hat on at work, assembling repeatable processes and elegant solutions.<br />
    I've tried to stay fresh with Codecademy, but it's just not enough--I want more, and I want this to be an important part of my life's work.</p>
