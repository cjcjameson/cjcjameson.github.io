    <p> Hi there! I'm C.J. Jameson. I've been thinking in code since I was young, but I'm a recently minted web developer / software engineer.</p>
    <p> At Stanford, I took 5 CS courses (Java and C++, algorithms and statistical analysis, etc.), but never got immersed in the coding culture. So in the summer of 2014, I attended Dev Bootcamp: I learned full-stack web development, mostly in Ruby on Rails, Javascript, and PostgreSQL. Since then, I've picked up a little Python and freshened up my Java chops.<br />
    Until March 2014, I was a management consultant for biotechs, but I'm most excited when I get to put my engineer's hat on at work, assembling repeatable processes and elegant solutions.</p>
